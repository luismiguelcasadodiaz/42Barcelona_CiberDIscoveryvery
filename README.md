In my first day, I discovered that the knolewdge kidnnaps us, and carries us thru the long way and blinds us towardas short path.

After long technical discussions involving nslookup, RFC, protocols, ports and so on, that took us to nowhere, the solution was the web **"instant username"**, a web used to know username availability in differente social media platforms.

Another learning to take away was the usage of google lens to locate where, a photo with no gps metadata, has been shooted.
